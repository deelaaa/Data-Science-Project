# Vaccinesâ€™ Brands Affect on Vaccination Hesitancy Rate Among Students in Malaysia

Project status: Completed

## Overview
Various vaccines were approved to be administered to the public in Malaysia to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This study specifically looks into 4 vaccines used namely Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinovac, Astrazeneca and CanSino and the target participants for this study were IIUM students. This work tried to find out whether or not a vaccine brand influences the decision of students taking the vaccine along with their educational background and influence of people around them. The data was collected through the use of a survey that was sent out to IIUM students asking various questions such as the side effects received from their first vaccines, their educational background, their motivation to take the vaccine and most importantly, would they be willing to take a 5th vaccine if required.
