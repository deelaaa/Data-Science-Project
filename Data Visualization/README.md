## Goal
To explore descriptive analysis by visualizing the data in Python and understanding what happened.
## Problem
What are the association between individual background status such as gender, education level, major field, etc with the number of developers working in programming community?
## Objectives
1. To identify age range among the developers
2. To determine which gender contribute the most to the number of developers
3. To figure out either educational level is crucial to join programming community
4. To identify how major of study affect the career to be a developer
5. To determine the employment status working in programming field
6. To determine the country with the highest number of people work as developers
7. To investigate which ethnicity contribute the most to the number of developers
## Result and Discussion

*Number of developers by country*
![image](https://github.com/deelaaa/Data-Science-Project/assets/129021858/7d27bcdc-a18c-4a29-9099-075c0d65499e)
- There are 131 countries in total however, we are going to analyse only top 20 countries as shown in previous graph.
- The bar graph shows that there is a huge number of developers coming from United States (US) which the total number of developers from US are 3072.
- Followed by United Kingdom with 724 developers.
- Even though UK comes in second place however, the graph shows a huge gap of number between US and UK with 2348 difference.
- The last 20 country is Turkey with total 87 developers.

*Number of developers by ethnicity*

- Majority of the developers are from white/European descent where there are 6924 of them represent programming community
- The least number of ethnic joined programming community was Native American, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous Australian where there are only 66 of them which makes them as the underrepresented community in programming

*Developers' age range*

- It can be seen that the dataset is positively skewed as the median is closer to the bottom of the box.
 There are 12 outliers which represent the rare ages of the developers where we rarely found a developer aged above 48 years old.
- The min age of developers are 16 years old and the max age of developers are 60 years old.
- 25% of the respondents are 25 years old
- 50% of them are 29 years old
- and 75% are 35 years old

*Gender contribute the most in programming community*

*Education level to join programming community*

- All of the developers have educational background
- Majority of the developers pursue their education up untill bachelor's degree where the total number of them are 5625
- Only 150 of the developers hold profesional degree where it is the least number of educational level took by developers.

*Field of study*
![image](https://github.com/deelaaa/Data-Science-Project/assets/129021858/1d99bcc1-6b3d-4a15-ba51-640b983f39a0)
- As expected most of the developers studied in computer science field.
- However there are also developers came from different area of studies which unrelated to programming such as health science, fine arts, business discipline and etc.
- This shown that anyone can pursue their career as a developer as long as he/she has the skill needed to be a developer such as programming and solving-problem skill.
- Logically thinking, those skills can be learned online and there are many materials of IT areas available across the Internet.

*Employment*

- The pie chart shows that allof the developers are employed either full-time or part-time
- Majority of them are employed full-time compared to part-time where 97% of them are successfully employed full-time meanwhile only 3% of them are employed part-time respectively.
- This shown that pursue career in programming in in demand as it easily offered you to get employed regardless of your individual status or background such as your ethnicity, filed of study and many more as long as you have the skills needed.
