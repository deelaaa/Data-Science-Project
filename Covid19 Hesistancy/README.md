Project status: Completed

_This is my Data Science group project where we have to apply data science processes starting from data collection until model development. In the end, we communicate our findings to the whole class and provide a prescriptive analysis of what the government should do to counter the issue that arises._

## Overview
This study specifically looks into 4 vaccines used namely Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinovac, AstraZeneca, and CanSino. The target participants for this study were IIUM students. This work tried to find out whether or not a vaccine brand influences the decision of students taking the vaccine along with their educational background and the influence of people around them. The data was collected through the use of a survey that was sent out to IIUM students asking various questions such as the side effects received from their first vaccines, their educational background, their motivation to take the vaccine, and most importantly, whether would they be willing to take a 5th vaccine if required.
