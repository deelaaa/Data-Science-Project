## Research questions
### Descriptive Analysis
1. What is the average age of employees based on gender?
2. How many employers are primarily tech companies?
### Exploratory Analysis
1. Is an employee willing to discuss a mental health issue in an interview for those who think that discussing it with the employer would not have negative consequences and are eager to discuss it with the supervisor?
2. Are the employees easy to take a medical leave for a mental health condition?
3. Do many employers provide mental health benefits?
### Inferential Analysis
1. Do juniors and middles typically seek mental health treatment more than seniors?
2. Do employees from tech companies tend to seek mental health treatment?
3. Do many employees feel their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health if it is somewhat easy and very easy for them to take medical leave for a mental health condition?
4. Are the employees more likely to develop mental illness if there is a family history of it?
### Predictive Analysis
1. Which factors contribute the most to the workers seeking mental illness treatment?
### Prescriptive Analysis
1. What should be done by the employer to overcome the issue of not trying to seek mental health treatment among their employees?
2. What is the role of a co-worker to conquer this problem?
## Algorithms
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Naiive Bayes (NB)
3. CNN + NB + Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Conclusion
From this project, we gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to mental health issues in the tech industry. Besides, we are able to evaluate the effectiveness of the available mental health support and resources, and predict the mental health of tech employees in the future. The findings of this research could have important implications for improving the mental well-being of tech workers and creating a healthier work environment in the tech industry.
